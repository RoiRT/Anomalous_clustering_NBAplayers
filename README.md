# Anomaly Detection by Analyzing NBA Players


## Description

The aim of this project is to cluster NBA players based on their age and performance improvement in key efficiency statistics, comparing Playoff data versus Regular Season data. This is a highly sought-after value for current contender teams, and its identification and market anticipation capabilities are strong assets in the league planning. Once this is achieved, we will seek to identify anomalies within each cluster to gain a better understanding of these groupings.
